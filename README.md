Abstract: In public health and safety, precise detection of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) plays a critical role in implementing responsive interventions that can save lives. While previous research has primarily focused on computer-based or neuropsychological tests for BAC identification, the potential use of daily smartphone activities for BAC detection in real-life scenarios remains largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (I-ADL), our hypothesis suggests that Smartphone-based Activities of Daily Living (S-ADL) can serve as a viable method for identifying BAC. In our proof-of-concept study, we propose, design, and assess the feasibility of using S-ADLs to detect BAC in a scenario-based controlled laboratory experiment involving 40 young adults. In this study, we identify key S-ADL metrics, such as delayed texting in SMS, site searching, and finance management, that significantly contribute to BAC detection (with an AUC-ROC and accuracy of 81%). We further discuss potential real-life applications of the proposed BAC model.

## Environment
We have run this code under the environment as below:
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04 installed with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
    * This code highly depends on a python multiprocessing library, [ray](https://www.ray.io/) which does not fully support Windows OS.
* CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5900x 12-Core
    * This is not mandatory; you can run this code (with a minor modification) although you have the smaller number of cores.
* RAM: 128GB
    * This is not mandatory; we expected about 40GB of RAM to be required (but not tested).

In addition, you need to install [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html#) for managing packages and virtual environment.
